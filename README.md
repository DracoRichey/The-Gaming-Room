# The-Gaming-Room
completed software design document
The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms. I kept this document clear, concise, and to the point.
It aids in keeping your focus on the task on hand and to decide on what tasks are important and which ones don't need time and focus on.
If I knew what I could improve on and how to do it I would. I did the best I could with the knoledge I have now.
I took what the functionality of the game and helped modularized it up so that there would be less work and time spend expanding to other operating platforms. All while still keeping the game the same. Your client may be the one to ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If they don't trust the software or have problems with it then they won't use it and no more product.
I put my focus on clear documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
